# Hi there, I'm Linus

I am an M.Sc. Student in Applied Physics & Electrical Engineering – International, Japanesewith a focus on **Data Science and Machine Intelligence**.  
I enjoy turning complex theory into working code, visualizing data in unique ways and exploring algorithms for uncertain or incomplete information, with a growing interest in **computer vision, signal and image processing**.
